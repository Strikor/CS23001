Looking at the profile table for sort.cpp (Bubble Sort) reveals that repeatedly calling
the vector values take the longest time but this isn't a bottle necks as it's time
isn't due to inefficency, but rather the the sheere amount of times it's called.
This is just inherant to bubble sort and really can't be helped. However within bubble
sort there is the function LESS_THAN(int, int), this function is entirely pointless as
it results in a massive amount of time spent initializing the function with temporary
local variables and must the perform one simple action on them (the less than operator)
This wastes time and can be removed with a noticable improvement in time taken to
run the program.
