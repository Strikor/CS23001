Project Grades - Each Milestone out of 100%

P1

M1 - 90 (regrade) - prints single digits now, except for 0 still;
M2 - 90 (regrade) - added a few more test cases, but would still want to see more, and more variety; 
M3 - 90 (regrade) - still not that many test cases;

Extra: 50

P2

M1 - 75 (regrade) - fails in concat -> based off console out seems to be infinitely concating; still lacking decent test cases
M2 - 95 - no mem leaks in valgrind, but lots of invalid writes of size 1;
M3 - 90 - ok num of test cases, but split should work with any char not just " " and "-";
M4 - 100

P3

M1 - 100 - you can just assert directly the stackObj.pop == expectedVal in your asserts, since pop returns T;
M2 - 90 - expected own test/data txt file;
M3 - 95 - spacing/formatting for assembly wrong -> spaces not tabs;

Extra: 95

P4

M1 - 90 (regrade)
M2 - 90 (regrade)
